# Omniglot

Recognizing handwritten characters has been a subject of research for many years, and various techniques have been developed to tackle this problem. However, it remains a challenging task due to the different writing styles, shapes, and sizes, and there is a pressing need to develop more accurate and reliable methods. One of the major challenges in this area is the ability to recognize characters from a limited number of examples, especially when there are many classes to identify, each with only a few examples. This is known as the one-shot learning problem, which has gained attention in recent years.

The Omniglot dataset is widely used for one-shot learning, a deep learning technique that aims to learn from a small number of examples. It comprises handwritten characters from 50 different alphabets, each with varying numbers of characters, and 20 different samples written by different people for each character. In total, there are 1623 classes in the dataset, making it particularly challenging for one-shot learning.

Our project aims to explore the effectiveness of deep learning approaches, specifically Siamese networks and transfer learning with ResNet, for one-shot learning on the Omniglot dataset. We aim to compare our proposed method's performance with a baseline CNN model and previous works on the same dataset. Our goal is to improve classification accuracy and demonstrate the potential of deep learning approaches for one-shot learning in complex classification tasks. Ultimately, we aim to develop a more accurate and robust method for recognizing handwritten characters, which could have practical applications in document digitization, text recognition, and biometrics.

We hope our research will contribute to the advancement of deep learning techniques for one-shot learning and inspire further research in this area. By developing more accurate and robust methods for recognizing handwritten characters, we believe that our work could have significant implications in various fields.
